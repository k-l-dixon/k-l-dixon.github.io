### Understanding Design Patterns

Software design patterns are considered general, reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design.  Much like the application of an alogorithm in various programming languages that each accomplishes the same or similar tasks.  At a higher conceptual level, design patterns provide a framework of processes developers can be use to handle common problem occurences, a system of systems.  Design patterns are well-proven and substantiated "lessons learned" from predecessors that assist in developmental processes by allowing designers to build upon these trials and tribulations as opposed to "reinventing the wheel" in some cases.  Design patterns are **NOT** concrete pieces of software, but abstractions utilized to "frame" solutions from.
