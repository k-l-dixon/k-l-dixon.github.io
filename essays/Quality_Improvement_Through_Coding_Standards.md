Software engineering is a team driven process.  When developing code, other programmers will inevitably review your code for various reasons such as debugging or establishing an understanding of the code itself.  In large organizations, teams may become divided into smaller sub-teams working on multiple areas of the same code overall.  Working with lengthy and complex pieces of code, a concern with each team would be merging their sections together in the end product.  A typical problem that arises are situations where functions or variables are defined and used in one area, but conflicts with how they are used in another area.  Another problem falls along the lines in debugging.  Situations where each section codes in an entirely different manner from each other, challenges arise attempting to read, understand, and troubleshoot if needed.
