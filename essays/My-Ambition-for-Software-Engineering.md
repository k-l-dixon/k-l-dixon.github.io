## My Interest in Software Engineering

My interests in software engineering stem from my desire to effectively lead others.  After taking a software engineering course for my undergraduate degree, once upon a time, I had an impression that I’ve only really scratched the surface of really understanding the concepts and processes presented then.  I had a really limited scope of understanding of the field.  I was convinced that the field only really relied on the technical programming aspect of the field, something that wasn’t appealing to me.

My time throughout the military had broadened this scope.  I saw similarities where I felt what made me successful in the military may allow me to be successful in the software engineering field.  This idea even extended to my time playing organized sports (Basketball, Taekwondo, Volleyball).  These similarities involved soft skills needed in order to be successful in software engineering.  Skills such as being an effective communicator, working well in teams, attention to detail, and problem solving.  These skills, in which I felt I had been able to sufficiently develop, has led me to an interest in exploring the idea of effectively guiding and directing software development teams.         

Now this could range anywhere from working with application developers, web developers, or even game developers.  Ultimately, my goal is to have the opportunity to develop processes, create project plans, communicate information, and work closely with teams until project completion.  I believe that this goal inherently requires that I myself be significantly familiar with the software development process.  In addition, I will need to ensure that I become extremely proficient with, at minimum, the soft skills previously mentioned.  

Back to my original notion of the field, “technical programming only.”  Another goal I aim to develop are the programming skills associated with the field.  Not just in one programming language, but multiple languages to add diversity in my own skill set.  Armed with a different mindset, I aim to be as well prepared and as well-rounded as possible as I explore this software engineering field.
